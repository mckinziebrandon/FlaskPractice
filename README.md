# Interactive Flask and JavaScript

Learning by doing with Flask, TypeScript, and more. Good reference material for anyone looking to learn more about Flask, and follows best practices for application structure and common Flask-related code conventions. I plan on doing more with this in the future, but development has been put on pause for the foreseeable future.
